To implement Nosto manually you will need to go through the following steps to ensure that the store data is captured by Nosto. The following steps will allow Nosto to gather product, cart and order data, and analyze how individual customers are interacting with this data. The implementation steps listed here are necessary for both functionalities based on crowd logic and 1-1 behavioral personalization.

**Steps needed to achieve basic data exchange between a online store and Nosto:**

  * [Add the Nosto Script](Add-Nosto-script)
  * [Add the Product Tagging](Product-Tagging)
  * [Add the Category Tagging](Category-Tagging)
  * [Add the Cart Tagging](Cart-Tagging)
  * [Add the Order Tagging](Order-Tagging)

If the store is built on explicitly supported platforms like Magento, Magento 2, Shopify, Prestashop or Shopware you should go through their platform specific guides instead.
