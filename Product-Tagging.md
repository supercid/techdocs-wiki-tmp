All product pages should contain the product tagging. The product tagging can be the entire metadata or only a small subset of it.

The product tagging is used to pass the context of the current product being viewed which in turn is used to personalise the recommendations e.g. cross-sellers, and is also periodically crawled by Nosto to build an index.

**Note:** The product tagging _must_ be server-side rendered as the Nosto crawler does not execute Javascript.
